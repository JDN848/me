TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Found a dataset and looked through the information.
Starting to think about how I could explore the data.
Thinking about what other supplemental data I could use in conjunction.
Debating whether-or-not I want to put in the effort... Do I even have the time?
