TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Apparently this is the final set that I really need to be doing and I dont need to do set 5? which is awesome news.
Scared for the exam next but at least that's only 5% of the mark.
Dont know where to begin with the data project.
Constant feeling im gonna fail becuase I'm mostly just drifting along with a vague idea of what the end outcome is gonna be.
Might die later.
