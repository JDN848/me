TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Found a dataset and looked through the information.
Starting to think about how i could explore the data.
Thinking about what other supplemental data I could use in conjuction.
Debating whether or
not I want to put in the effort... I do even have the time?
